# Project 2 - Combinational Logic

## Objective

The purpose of this design assignment was to create modules of combinational logic in the Verilog Hardware Description Language (HDL) format. While completing this task, students continued immersing themselves in the Xilinx platform and the Verilog HDL. Through this assignment the team: prepared truth tables, wrote Verilog code per module, and made test fixtures to test each module. The assignment tasked the group to create: a full adder, a 4-bit adder, a three bit comparator, a 4-16 decoder, a priority encoder, and a 4-1 multiplexer.
