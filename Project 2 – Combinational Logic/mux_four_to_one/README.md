# 4-1 Multiplexer

## Objective

This 4-1 multiplexer takes an input of four bits and another input of 2-bits and outputs the selected input. In this module, the two bits are the select bits that would select which one the inputs should be designated as the output. 

## Waveforms

Simulation results from the Verilog representation of this 4-1 Multiplexer
