# Project 1 - Introduction to Xilinx

## Objective

The main goal of this lab is to create a verilog module, and through a test bench, analyze its waveform model once a schematic, and source code is created using the software, Xilinx ISE. Through this process, the team will be able to obtain a deeper understanding of how logic gates, or boolean logic, interacts with verilog code by analyzing certain scenarios that these two demonstrate.
