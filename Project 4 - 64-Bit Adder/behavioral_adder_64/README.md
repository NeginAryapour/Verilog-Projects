# Behavioral Adder (64-bit)

## Objective

This model was an abstracted implementation of a full adder written in a behavioral Verilog sense with no specific logic circuit design. 

This module tested: all possible combinations from 0 to 31 and, seperately, two large 32-bit integers. 

## Waveforms

Test 1: Simulation results from the Verilog representation of this Behavioral Adder **(All possible combinations from 0 to 31)**

Test 2: Simulation results from the Verilog representation of this Behavioral Adder **(Two large 32-bit integers)**
